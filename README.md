# My Reactive-Webpage
This is the code I used to make my personal webpage. https://www.jasonvholmes.com

The original code I used came from https://colorlib.com/ but I made my own edits to their code in order to make the code suit my needs.

Some of the links and images in this repo are mine. Feel free to switch them with yours. If you don't mind, follow me and give me a shot out that you used my code. I am actually learning how to code so any feedback and support is much appreciated. 

Other than that, enjoy.
